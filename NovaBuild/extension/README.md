# Nova OP-Scripter - AI Roblox Studio Agent (DeepSeek, Gemini, Kimi, GLM, Qwen, Arena)

Control Roblox Studio with AI, for free. Nova turns a normal AI chat (DeepSeek, Google Gemini, Kimi, GLM, Qwen, or Arena) into an agent that builds and scripts your Roblox game for you: just describe what you want, and it reads/edits scripts, runs Luau, inspects the game tree, and generates assets directly in Roblox Studio. No API key, no terminal, no coding required.

It's a Chrome/Edge browser extension plus a small local bridge that connects the chat to Roblox Studio through the official MCP server. **DeepSeek is the recommended provider.** Gemini, Kimi, GLM, Qwen and Arena also work but can be less stable: Gemini tends to stop using the Roblox tools in long sessions, and Kimi sometimes reaches for its own native tools instead of the Roblox commands. On Arena, keep the mode dropdown on **Direct** (Nova only supports Direct mode).

## Setup

**Load the extension manually (Edge or Chrome):**
1. Go to `edge://extensions` (Edge) or `chrome://extensions` (Chrome)
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top right toggle)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `zeroscript-extension` folder
5. The extension is now active

**Then set up the Bridge:**
1. **Download the Bridge** from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/sebattfg/Nova-Free)
2. **Open Roblox Studio** and load a Place
3. **Enable the MCP server in Roblox Studio** (first time only): click **Assistant AI** in the top bar, then **...** > **Manage MCP Servers** > **Enable Studio as MCP Server**
4. **Run start-novaect.bat** - a small window opens, the Bridge is running
5. **Go to https://chat.deepseek.com** (recommended), https://gemini.google.com, https://www.kimi.com, https://chat.z.ai, https://chat.qwen.ai, or https://arena.ai, open a new chat (only works on these exact addresses; on Arena use Direct mode)
6. Click **Start session** in the Nova panel
7. Type what you want to build

## Architecture (for contributors)

The extension is split between a provider-agnostic core and per-AI-site providers:

```
core/config.js        system prompt, feedback strings, tool categories (global ZS)
core/parser.js        Nova command parsing - pure string logic   (global NVParse)
core/main.js          agentic loop, UI, camouflage, session state      (uses NVProvider)
providers/deepseek.js everything DeepSeek-specific: DOM selectors, generation
                      detection, send mechanics, composer modes…       (global NVProvider)
providers/gemini.js   same interface for Google Gemini (Angular DOM, Quill
                      composer, code-block masking)                    (global NVProvider)
providers/kimi.js     same interface for Kimi / Moonshot AI (Vue DOM, Lexical
                      composer, segment-code masking)                  (global NVProvider)
providers/glm.js      same interface for GLM / Z.ai (Svelte DOM, code-block
                      wrapper masking)                                 (global NVProvider)
providers/qwen.js     same interface for Qwen / chat.qwen.ai (Vue DOM, network-tap
                      SSE stream, Monaco disposal guard)               (global NVProvider)
providers/qwen-net.js MAIN-world fetch tap for Qwen SSE stream        (injected by manifest)
providers/arena.js    same interface for Arena / arena.ai (React DOM, multi-model
                      playground, A/B-comparison auto-commit, Direct-mode gate) (global NVProvider)
background.js         WebSocket to the local bridge (provider-agnostic)
```

`core/main.js` never touches the host site's DOM directly - it only calls the
`NVProvider` interface. To integrate another AI site: write a new
`providers/<site>.js` exporting the same interface, then add its URL pattern to
`manifest.json` (`content_scripts` + `host_permissions`) and to
`PROVIDER_URLS` in `background.js`. No core change required.

Run `node test-parser.js` to smoke-test the command parser.
